Task 2: 
Generating Images from Sketch Descriptions with Stable Diffusion

● Objective: Utilize Stable Diffusion to generate realistic images based on textual
descriptions obtained from Task 1.

● Introduce Stable Diffusion and discuss its capabilities and limitations.

● Use the captions generated in Task 1 as inputs to Stable Diffusion to synthesize
realistic images that match the sketch descriptions.

● Assess the quality and relevance of the generated images to the original
sketches and descriptions.


To run the task 2, run the python notebook given above and run the compare_images.py for calculating the SSIM similarity score for two images.
In the python file, we have the results for the controlnet guidance as well
