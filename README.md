# Project Overview

This project aims to bridge the gap between abstract sketches and realistic images through advanced AI techniques. Students will learn to generate descriptive captions for sketches, create realistic images from these sketches, fine-tune a generative model to improve its output, and apply conditional generation to control specific aspects of the generated images.

## Task 1: Image Captioning with Sketches

- **Objective:** Use an image captioning model (e.g., LLaVA or BLIP-2) to generate textual descriptions for sketches from the Sketchy database.
- **Activities:**
  - Explore and select an appropriate image captioning model.
  - Preprocess sketches to fit the input requirements of the chosen model.
  - Generate captions for a subset of sketches and evaluate the descriptiveness and accuracy of the generated captions.

## Task 2: Generating Images from Sketch Descriptions with Stable Diffusion

- **Objective:** Utilize Stable Diffusion to generate realistic images based on textual descriptions obtained from Task 1.
- **Activities:**
  - Introduce Stable Diffusion and discuss its capabilities and limitations.
  - Use the captions generated in Task 1 as inputs to Stable Diffusion to synthesize realistic images that match the sketch descriptions.
  - Assess the quality and relevance of the generated images to the original sketches and descriptions.

## Task 3: Fine-Tuning Stable Diffusion for Sketch-Based Image Generation

- **Objective:** Fine-tune Stable Diffusion on the Sketchy database to enhance its ability to generate high-quality images from sketches.
- **Activities:**
  - Discuss the concept of fine-tuning and its importance in model performance improvement.
  - Implement a fine-tuning procedure using DreamBooth, targeting the generation of images that more closely resemble the content and style of the sketches.
  - Compare the performance and output quality before and after fine-tuning.
